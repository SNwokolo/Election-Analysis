# Election-Analysis
using python to gather data on election results

## **Overview of Project**
The purpose of this project was to assist Tom, a board of elections employee in performing an election audit for a particular precinct in Colorado. The project involved obtaining the list of candidates and counties in the running and calculating the total amount of votes altogether and then for each candidate and county in order to determine the final winner of the election.

## **Resources** 
Python 3.9.12 and Visual Studio code Version: 1.71.0 (Universal)

## **Results**
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369, 711 votes cast in the election
- The election candidates were:
    Charles Casper Stockham
    Diana DeGette 
    Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
    Charles received 85, 213 votes while Diana received 272, 892 votes and
    finally Raymon received 11,606 votes.
- The winner of the election was: 
    Candidate Diana Degette who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes in total
- The counties in the precinct for this election are:
    Jefferson with a vote count of 38,855 and 10.5% of the total votes,
    Denver with a vote count of 306, 055 and 82.8% of the total votes,
    Arapahoe with a vote count of 24,801 and 6.7% of the total votes
    From the data above, the county with the largest number of votes was Denver.

## **Challenge Summary**

From the data provided and accurate results obtained using this particular script, I would like to propose the use of the script for other upcoming elections. A few modifications would need to be made to the script in order for it to run more efficiently. The data that will be used in the analysis could include the names of political parties in the running and the number of votes allocated to them for different counties, towns, etc. Another thing the data could include would be the ages/races of the voters and how that relates their chosen candidates in order to allow trends to be studied across various elections over time.
various elections over time.
